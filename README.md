## Zombie Game

The goal of our term project is to design a multiplayer third-person shooter game using the Unity game engine and Photon Unity Networking. The Zombie Game is a multiplayer game that allows teams of 2 to 5 people to be formed. The game begins with a login scene that allows the user logging, create a room, show active rooms, join a room, and start the game. 

There are 2 different maps in the game, and all maps have procedurally generated mazes. All players start to game in a different piece of the maze. The first aim of the players is to complete the maze and reaching to the map. Another aim is not dying against zombies. If any player on the team would die, the team will lose, and the team has to play at the same level again. Otherwise, the team will win the game and deserves to switch to the new map. 

All maps contain mazes according to their structure, and these mazes have recreated each time the game starts. We created the mazes using the Recursive Depth First Search Maze Generation algorithm.
